The template program is a skeleton for strategies.

It implements the Strategy API defined by Cove. Strategists can fork this repo and implement the
deposit/withdraw functions as defined here - or they can define the same instructions (with 
arbitrary instruction IDs) within their own more complex program.

TODO:
* Specify Cove testnet address for integration testing.
